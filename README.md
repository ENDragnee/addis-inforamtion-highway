## Project Synopsis

### Problem Statement
In Ethiopia, critical public and private sector data is stored in isolated, non-communicating silos. This fragmentation leads to massive inefficiencies for both citizens and institutions. For example, a citizen might have to provide the same identification and documentation repeatedly to different government agencies (e.g., for business registration, tax filing, and healthcare). This process is slow, prone to errors, and lacks a secure, standardized method for data exchange, hindering the development of modern, integrated digital services.

### Planned Solution
Inspired by Estonia's X-Road, the **Addis Information Highway** is a project to build a secure, decentralized data exchange layer for Ethiopia. This is not a centralized database; instead, it's a technological and organizational environment that allows different information systems to communicate and share data securely. The platform will provide a standardized protocol for authentication, logging, and encrypted data transfer, enabling seamless interoperability between government agencies, banks, hospitals, and other entities.

Our solution will act as the backbone for a new generation of digital services, enabling once-only data provision and creating a truly connected digital society.

### Expected Outcome
By the end of the hackathon, we aim to have a functional Proof-of-Concept (PoC) that demonstrates the core functionality of the Addis Information Highway. This will include:
*   A central server mock-up to manage member and service registries.
*   Two sample "service provider" applications (e.g., a mock Ministry of Health and a mock Commercial Bank) that can exchange data securely over the highway.
*   A demonstration of a user-consented data request, authenticated via Fayda.
*   A simple dashboard to visualize transaction logs and system status.

The ultimate goal is to lay the foundation for a scalable and robust national information highway that can transform public service delivery in Ethiopia.

### Fayda's Role (Recommended)
Fayda is the cornerstone of the Addis Information Highway's trust and security model. It serves as the primary mechanism for citizen identification and consent.

*   **Authentication:** When a service (e.g., a bank) requests a citizen's data from another service (e.g., the national business registry), the citizen will authenticate themselves using their Fayda ID to grant or deny access.
*   **Authorization:** Fayda will be used to verify the identity of the end-user, ensuring that data is only shared with explicit, verifiable consent. This puts citizens in control of their personal information.
*   **Secure Identity Layer:** By integrating with VeriFayda's OIDC, we leverage a secure, government-backed digital identity, eliminating the need for each service to build its own authentication system and providing a unified identity across the entire ecosystem.

### Tech Stack
*   **Backend:** Node.js with Nextjs for building the core API and communication protocols.
*   **Security:** NextAuth JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for securing API endpoints, TLS for encrypted communication, and integration with the VeriFayda OIDC provider for user authentication.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL for storing transaction logs, service registries, and security server configurations.
*   **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose to ensure a consistent development and deployment environment for all microservices.
*   **Frontend (for Demo Dashboard):** React.js to build a simple user interface for demonstrating the data exchange process and system monitoring.
*   **API Protocol:** RESTful APIs for communication between the different components of the system.
